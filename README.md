# shot - the Simple Hospital Outbreak Tracker

Simply put: an open source solution to tracking infections in small and large health institutions. It defaults to a desktop GUI environment written in PySimpleGUI, but will eventually be decoupled so both a web interface and an API are available. The idea being that we're providing open source software to the health sector.

TODO:
* decouple "business logic" and GUI
* FastAPI


Requirements:
* PySimpleGUI
* pandas
* time
* csv
* Path (from pathlib)
(requirements.txt coming)
